# kratos-fast-timeout

Timeout override middleware with route-based scope and fast-path shortening.

[中文说明](README.zh.md)

<!-- TEMPLATE (EN) CLOSE: LANGUAGE NAVIGATION -->

## Main Features

- ⏱️ **Fast Timeout**: Shorten timeout on specific routes via route scope configuration
- 🎯 **Route Scope**: INCLUDE/EXCLUDE mode to choose which routes get fast timeout
- 🔄 **Context-Based**: Integrates with Go context timeout mechanism (shortest wins)
- 🪵 **Debug Logs**: Each route match goes to the logger at debug level, and the logger level decides if it shows

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/yylego/kratos-fast-timeout
```

## Design Intent

A context timeout can be shortened but not extended, so "give a few slow routes more time" is set up in reverse:

1. Set the service timeout to the long time the slow routes need.
2. Use `NewExclude` to leave out the slow routes, and this middleware cuts each remaining route down to the fast timeout.

An upstream deadline that is tight to begin with stays as it is and does not get stretched.

## Usage

```go
package server

import (
    "log/slog"
    "time"

    "github.com/go-kratos/kratos/v3/transport/grpc"
    "github.com/yylego/kratos-auth/authkratos"
    "github.com/yylego/kratos-fast-timeout/fastkratostimeout"
)

func NewGRPCServer(applog *slog.Logger) *grpc.Server {
    // Each route except the slow report export gets 3 seconds
    slowScope := authkratos.NewExclude("/api.v1.Demo/ExportReport")
    cfg := fastkratostimeout.NewConfig(slowScope, 3*time.Second)

    return grpc.NewServer(
        grpc.Timeout(5*time.Minute), // The service timeout, set to what the slowest route needs
        grpc.Middleware(fastkratostimeout.NewMiddleware(cfg, applog)),
    )
}
```

The fast timeout must be above zero: a value of 0 and below makes `NewMiddleware` panic at startup, since each matched request would time out at once.
